##Golang/Gorilla Mux + MySQL/SQLX Example

An example of how we can organize work with [sqlx](http://jmoiron.github.io/sqlx/) and [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/) in [Golang/Http](https://golang.org/) and [Gorilla](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux) web toolkit.

Package gorilla/mux implements a request router and dispatcher.
SQLX is a package for Golang which provides a set of extensions on top of the excellent built-in database/sql package. 

Final result we can deploy on the [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) hosting.
